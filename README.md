# Money transfer: Java project starter/playground

This is a playfork of the Temporal money transfer project that can be used as a template to start building your own Temporal Workflow application. It's pretty neat.

See the [Run your first app tutorial](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/java/run-your-first-app-tutorial) to learn more about the original tutorial and where this came from.

This project uses [Snipsync](https://github.com/temporalio/snipsync) comment wrappers to automatically keep code snippets up to date within our documentation. Also neat.

I make no promises of keeping this a working, useful Temporal sample app, see above and upstream for the good stuff.
